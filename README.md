### Problem Statement

Our firm wants to diversify our portfolio by getting into the real estate business in Ames, Iowa. Like any instrument, we want to know if our return will make the investment worthwhile.
Using available data, build a linear regression model for estimating the sale price of a home. Which types of attributes are good indicators of value and which detract? How accurate can we be?

### Executive Summary

The project is separated into two parts: (1) EDA and Cleaning (2) Regression and Analysis
<br><br>
(1) EDA and Date Cleaning
The workbook imports the Ames housing dataset comprised of 2051 individual residential properties sold in Ames, Iowa from 2006 to 2010. Each record included 78 exploratory variables and the target variable sale price. Each exploratory variable was cleaned, examined, and analyzed for inclusion in the final model. Techniques such as null-handling through imputation, dummy variables on categorical variables, and outlier removal were used as well as engineering new features from the data.

(2) Regression and Analysis
84 exploratory variables were initally available for modelling. An initial linear regression was performed across all exploratory variables and reviewed against a train-test split as well as cross validation scoring. The variables were then standard scaled to perform Lasso and Ridge regressions. Finally, feature selection through both Lasso cross validation and Ridge cross validation were performed, indicating that only 57 the original 84 exploratory variables were important to our model. These 57 variables were kept and linear regression was again performed on regular scaled dataset to generate our model's final coefficients.

### Conclusions and Recommendations

There are a wide range of exploratory variables that have an affect on the target variable sale price according to our model. Witihin the context of the magnitude of these variables' units, the most impacting variables were identified.

Three most positively impacting variables:
  *  Membership in Neighborhood Grouping 3
    *  a generated collection of neighborhoods that had a mean sale price one standard deviation above the overal sale price mean.
    *  membership here adds \$33k in expected sale price holding all else constant
  *  Above Grade Living Area (Square Footage):
    *  every 500 sqft adds \$25k in expected sale price holding all else constant
  *  Location in 'Floating Village Residential' zone
    *  houses sold in this zone see a \$15k increase in expected sale price holding all else constant
    *  for context, the second highest-scoring zone is 'Residential Low Density' at \$4k

Three most negatively impacting variables:
  *  Presence of a basement
    *  houses with a basement saw a \$23K decrease in expected sale price holding all else constant
  *  Home Age
    *  each year before 2010 that a home was built decreases the expected sale price \$200 holding all else constant
    *  this translates to a \$20K difference for a home over 100 years old
  *  Home Remodels
    *  houses that were remodeled saw a \$3.6K decrease in expected sale price holding all else constant

In place of sufficient values being available for the 57 variables included in the model, prioritizing the above variables will maximize impact on the expected sale price.
